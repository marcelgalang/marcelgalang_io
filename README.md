This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and hosted on [Surge.sh](http://surge.sh).

[DEMO](http://jasonleecochran.com)

I am open sourcing my website so you can fork it and make it your own. If you
have opinions, please share them. Thanks!

## Setup

- Fork or clone this repo.
- If you are going to deploy to Surge.sh, modify the package.json under scripts -> deploy, where it says "echo jasonleecochran.com"; change to your domain name. Otherwise change the deploy script to deploy wherever you want or delete it entirely.

## Dev, Build and Deploy

- Dev: $ npm start
- Build: $ npm run build
- Deploy: $ npm run deploy
